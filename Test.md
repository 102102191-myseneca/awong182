## Part A - Adding Files - Local Repo Workflow:
1. Saved File [git_status_untracked.txt.txt](https://github.com/102102191-myseneca/CSN400-Capstone/blob/main/Checkpoint2/git_status_untracked.txt.txt/).
2. Pushed File [git_status_uncommitted.txt](https://github.com/102102191-myseneca/CSN400-Capstone/blob/main/Checkpoint2/git_status_uncommitted.txt.txt/).
3. Commited File [git_status_committed.txt](https://github.com/102102191-myseneca/CSN400-Capstone/blob/main/Checkpoint2/git_status_committed.txt.txt/).
